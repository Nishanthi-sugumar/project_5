Insights:

Based on the data visualization, several key insights can be derived:

1. Customer Loyalty:Customers who have chosen the Two-Year contract option have been with the company for a longer period, suggesting that this contract type promotes greater customer retention. Conversely, most customers on a Month-to-Month contract appear to be new additions to the company's customer base.
2. Churn Risk: The company faces a significant risk of losing recently acquired customers, particularly those on Month-to-Month contracts. This is a cause for concern as it could lead to a high churn rate.
3. Churn Rate and Revenue: Currently, there are 7,043 customers at risk of churning, resulting in a churn rate of 27%. The company generates $16.06 million in yearly charges and $456.12 thousand in monthly charges from these customers.
4. Ticket Analysis: There were 2,955 technical support tickets and 3,632 administrative tickets opened. This indicates that customers have been seeking assistance and support from the company.
5. Service Subscription: Many of the customers who churned did not subscribe to Online Security, Tech Support, or Phone Services. This suggests that promoting these services could potentially reduce churn by enhancing the overall customer experience.
6. Fiber Optic Issues: A significant proportion (42%) of the churned customers were using Fiber Optic as their Internet service, indicating potential issues or dissatisfaction with this service. This underscores the need to investigate and address any problems related to Fiber Optic services.


Recommendations:

Based on the insights, here are some actionable recommendations:

1. Promote Long-Term Contracts: Encourage customers to consider One-Year and Two-Year contracts by highlighting the cost benefits and stability they offer. Customers often pay more on a Month-to-Month basis, so offering incentives for longer-term commitments can be effective.
2. Discounts for Month-to-Month Customers: Provide discounts or special offers to customers on Month-to-Month contracts to incentivize them to stay with the company for a longer duration. This can help reduce churn among this group.
3. Educate on Service Benefits: Educate customers about the advantages of signing up for Online Security and Tech Support services. Highlight how these services can enhance their experience, increase security, and resolve technical issues promptly.
4. Increase Contract Sales: Aim to increase sales of One-Year and Two-Year contracts by 5% each. Additionally, encourage customers to opt for automatic payments on a yearly basis, increasing this option by 5%. These strategies can help improve customer retention and revenue stability.


By implementing these recommendations, the company can work towards reducing churn, increasing customer loyalty, and ultimately improving its financial performance.
